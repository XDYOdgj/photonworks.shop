As you can probably see, those of us who do, love it! A lovely friend gave me this canner as a gift (a real person that is, not the company or something) and I have been really enjoying it. I have personally steam bath canned many 1000's of jars over the past three plus decades, as did my mother before me. Learn how it works, and most folks would never go back to water bathing as it is overall so much easier with faster heating times and much less heavy hot water to heave around the kitchen. I only have a jar fail to seal about once ever three years and can 500 or so jars per year at least. The only jars that have broken for me in the past decade were a handful of brand new ones on their first use, which are much thinner and lower quality glass that my older jars. So take just a few minutes to learn the couple differences between steam and water bath canning and I think you will never go back. I have two older aluminum models inherited from my mother and a neighbor, as well as one more modern aluminum model I purchased. They all work perfectly and as the food inside a jar is never in contact with the canner, have never been concerned about them being aluminum. However, this very solid stainless steel version is quite nice! I think I could also turn the top upside down and use it as a spare stock pot if needed which I would not do with my old ones. The bottom reservoir is a little larger and deeper on this one than my old models which is nice as it makes it easier to never run it dry. With a steam canner you fill or top off the base with water between each canning batch so that you never run it dry which can crack your jars and destroy the canner. Just like every other kind of canner which should never be run dry either. The statement that it cuts canning time in half relates to how much less time it takes to heat a much smaller volume of water compared to water bath canning. The canning times are the same, though it is much more efficient to heat and move around a whole lot less volume of water for sure. Especially for those who have a hard time moving full heavy pots of water, this a big advantage! Of course it takes a lot less power/energy to heat a smaller volume of water too. The whole canner is a bit bigger and bulkier than my old ones with larger handles. Since it still holds 7 quart jars, doesn't really make a difference one way or another to me. I know many folks like the silicon covers on the handles, but I don't particularly since I often can outdoors on my big propane burner and it's flames are hot enough to sometime start to melt them (my most modern of the older canners has the same issue) but this isn't a big deal. Steam bath canning works for any item you would water bath can so I use this for various fruits, jams, tomato sauces, salsa, pickles, berry juices, etc. The only things we can that I need to pull out the pressure canner for are meats/broth. Yes, you can sterilize your jars in a steam bath canner. I just turn each jar upside down on the rack inside, put the cover on, and let the whole things start to steam just as if I were canning to get everything warmed and sterile while preparing my foods. This allows the water from the steam to drain back out of the jars. Just remove from the canner carefully with a hot pad or jar lifter when you are ready to fill them and they will be fully hot and clean. Overall, this canner works just as well as all my older models which are flawless and as I mentioned, have been safely preserving thousands of jars of food for our family for decades. What is better is it's larger bottom reservoir and beautifully thick stainless steel construction. So if I ever needed a new canner, I would purchase this one. Though given that I now have 4 that should all last a lifetime or more, especially this one since it is constructed of such thick stainless steel, that would only happen if I would be gifting it to someone else getting into canning. I would note that the jars included have no brand name and I am not sure of their sturdiness so I will probably use them for something like honey or herbs, not canning just to be safe. Since I already have 100's of high quality canning jars, that is an easy decision to make for me.Addressing a few things I saw mentioned in other reviews:No canning times listed in the instructions - Steam bath canning is done for exactly the same times as water bath canning for the same item. Their instructions might benefit from mentioning this for those who do not know. Use your favorite Ball Blue Book recipes for water bath canning times etc.No vent at the top - There is no way for a steam canner to have a top vent as they rely on filling from top to bottom with steam so the whole thing is full of steam. Hence, vents only at the bottom.No vent at the bottom - Someone didn't look at their canner. It's a small round hole just above the base of the top part of the canner.No temp gauge - While the more modern of my three old ones does have one, it's totally superfluous and I never look at it. Since water always boils at the same temp (with the same time variations for elevation as if you were water bath canning), to create sustained steam stream from the base of the canner, it has to be at the right temp.You still need other pots to sterilize jars - No, you can certainly use a steam bath canner to do that, see my description above.There is no pressure gauge - Steam canners do not pressurize, they vent the steam from the bottom once the entire top is full of steam so there is never any pressurization.No handle on the top - While I do have one canner that has this, it actually makes it much easier to give your self a steam burn when lifting the top. Side handles keep your arms off to the sides of the huge cloud of steam and are much better in my opinion.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-02 16:36:08"},{"user":"Lovetocook","content":"Made 10 three-quarter pints of chow chow relish (Ball Blue Book recipe) and this worked great without the hassle of submerging them in gallons of dangerously boiling water in an old fashioned boiling water bath canner. It does not have a temperature gauge because you don\u2019t need one. Concord has a YouTube video and read the directions that come with the canner. Always adhere to USDA canning times and you\u2019ll be fine. I liked the silicone covers on the pot handles. It\u2019s also really well made from heavy gauge stainless steel. Wish it was made in USA, but it is made in China.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-30 16:36:08"},{"user":"Shelly B","content":"So much more convenient for processing my jelly. I've used large pots of boiling water which is more cumbersome and takes longer to heat up. This is not for processing of vegetables as they are a low acid food and require a pressure canner.This canner worked fantastic on my induction stove top and my induction portable nuwave. We changed our our cooktop range for induction because we didn't like conventional electric and we don't have gas available. We can only use iron and stainless steel on the cook tops. So I was excited to find this steamer in a heavy weight stainless. It was a good value for the money. The processor has a large capacity and I was able to fit about 11, 1/2 pints in at a time. It comes with 6 quart size jars and lids. Which fit in together in one processing. This processor doesn't have a top gauge to let you know when it's up to the right steam pressure. Those types tend to cost more. All you need to do is insure you start your processing time when the water is at a rolling boiland keep it there the entire time, lowering heat level if it starts to boil rapidly enough to start \"spitting\" water out the edges. There is a guide that tells you how to use it that is pretty straight forward. You will need to look up the elevation where you live to insure you use the correct processing time.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-28 16:36:08"},{"user":"M.B.","content":"This was so easy. I've never used a steam canner and it was so easy and quick too! I used this canner to sanitize my jars and then after filling them, processed.This was the easiest jam I've ever made. I was able to do it in small batches over a few days because I didn't have to worry about a water bath.I did have one hiccup where I let it boil dry (first time user! Yikes!) and it did leave marks on the inside of the pot, but a little bar keepers friend and it seems to be coming off.This was on my induction stove canning pint jars of jam.It was unbelievably easy and worth every penny!Highly recommend!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-22 16:36:08"},{"user":"MomBoss29","content":"I received my Concord Steam Canner today (11/25/2024). I used it right away by processing 3 quarts of apple slices.The Canner is so easy to assemble and use. It is made of beautiful stainless steel.
